    <h1>Asthma Indoor Air Monitor</h1><hr>
<h2>Student Name: Sarah Barron</h2><hr>
<h2>About this project</h2><p>As a student at Waterford Institute of Technology one of the modules I am studying is computer networking. The project which were required to complete was to create a project using networking/IoT standards and protocols, to incorporated physical devices such as sensors and to incorporate different layers (sensor, processing node, gateway, application) of an IoT/connected device architecture.</p>
<h2>Computer Networking Protocols and Standards used</h2><h3>TCP/IP protocol Suite</h3><ul>

<h2>Project Proposal</h2><p>I currently have 2 asthma and allergy sufferers living in my house and there are a number of triggers that effect their asthma including </p>
<ol>
<li>Humidity (moist / damp air) </li>
<li>Temperature (mostly cold air but temperatures that are too high can also effect them)</li>
<li>Air quality - dust mites, smoke and chemicals such as hair spray, deodorants etc </li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the project I am proposing is a device to monitor indoor air quality, temperature and humidity within the home using a sensor.</p>
<p>When the sensor values go outside of the ideal values for an asthma sufferer. I will use the Blynk IoT application to send a notification to a my phone.</p>
<p>Every morning and night i will use the Blynk IoT application to send me a notification to remind me to give my 2 sons their asthma medication/inhaler.</p>
<p>Every morning I will send an email report with details of the average sensor values for the previous 24 hours. I will use ThingSpeak, MATLAB analysis, a time controller and IFTTT IoT application to accomplish this.</p>
<p>I will also send the sensor values to Blynk and ThingSpeak IoT applications every 15 seconds to allow me to store, retrieve and display sensor values on line graphs, number displays and gauges. The purpose of this is to allow me to check the current sensor values either on my phone or on my laptop at any time. It will also allow me to view the sensor data over longer periods of time to compare or have an overall view over time of air quality within the my home. This also allows me to complete MATLAB analysis on the sensor data.</p>
<p>There will be presence detection. I do not have access to my heating, humidifier or dehumidifier remotely. Therefore if I am in the house and the sensor values go out of range i will get a notification as I can do something about it when I am at home. However if there is nobody detected at home I will not receive out of range notifications as I can not do anything about it remotely. The settings for this can be changed by the user, if they want to receive notifications at all times when they are at home or when they are away from home they can set this up.</p>
<p>I also intend to create a website, that will show ThingSpeak graphs and current sensor readings and will describe the project.</p>
<h2>Project Details</h2><h3>Settings for Asthma Sufferers</h3><p>The general advice and from reading the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/276001/9789241550376-eng.pdf?ua=1">World Health Organization - Housing and Health Guidelines 2018</a>, I set the default temperature range to between 18-21 Celsius. 
However the maximum level a user can set the temperature to is 24 Celsius as recommended by WHO. 
The ideal temperature is 21 C.</p>
<p>Again the general advice for humidity or moisture levels for asthma sufferers is between 30 - 50% with an ideal humidity level of 40%. The programs default settings is a range between 30 - 50%. A user has the choice to narrow this range but can not increase the range, as outside this range would be unhealthy for asthma sufferers.</p>
<p>The Index Air Quality measurement is calculated using 20% Humidity : 80% Gas levels. 
I have set the default IAQ range to between 0 and 100 as above this level can lead to members of sensitive groups to experience health effects.<br>Between 50-100 Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. 
If the Asthma sufferer is unusually sensitive they have the option to reduce the default IAQ level down to a level they are happy with.</p>
<p>Initially the user will either use the sensor with the default values:</p>
<p>Temperature: 18-21 Celsius</p>
<p>Humidity: 30-50 %RH</p>
<p>Index Air Quality : 0-100 IAQ</p>
<p>or set their own values which must be set within healthy ranges for Asthma sufferers. This can be set up via a shell scripting menu before the sensor is run.</p>
<h4>BME680 Sensor -&gt; IoT&#39;s</h4><p>The BME680 sensor which is attached to the Raspberry Pi 3B senses the temperature, humidity and gas levels every 15 seconds and sends the values to Blynk an IoT mobile application that controls hardware remotely and to Thingspeak an IoT application that stores and displays sensor values and reacts using MATLAB Analysis, TimeControl and IFTTT another IoT application to manage services, to send an email to the user daily with the average temperature, humidity and IAQ levels for the previous 24 hours. </p>
<h4>Blynk</h4><p>When the Temperature, Humidity or Air Quality goes out of range the user will be sent a Blynk notification to inform them of this out of range value.</p>
<p>Blynk displays the 3 sensor values in numeric gauge form and with a color system.</p>
<p>For temperature and humidity values in range will show as green, just out of range will show as orange and a further out of range level will show as red. </p>
<p>The IAQ levels will show as their standard colors starting at a good level represented by green and as the IAQ gets worse the colors change from yellow to orange to red to purple and finally to burgundy.</p>
<p><img src="./images/IAQ.PNG" alt="Index Air Quality - Color Code"></p>
<h5>Presence Detection</h5><p>There is a presence detection setup using arp-scan, this detects if someone is in the house. If no-one is home the notifications will not be sent as the user can not control devices such as temperature, humidifier, dehumidifier etc remotely. However, if the user has remote access to devices they can set this up in the setup or main menu. The user will then receive notifications at all times as they have remote access to devices.</p>
<p>Using Blynk and an eventor, a notification is sent each morning and night to remind the user to take or give the inhaler medication to the Asthma Sufferer.</p>
<p>The User can use Blynks mobile App to view the current readings at any time and a line graph showing past readings for up to 3 months.</p>
<h4>ThingSpeak</h4><p>Data is also stored, retrieved and displayed on a ThingSpeak Channel, for the user to view or analyse.
Every morning Thingspeak has a time control setup to do MATLAB Analysis. 
The MATLAB analysis retrieves the previous 24 hours sensor readings. The average temperature, humidity and IAQ levels are calculated. These values are send using HTTP to IFTTT.</p>
<h4>IFTTT</h4><p>When IFTTT receives the trigger email each morning with the average values it enters these values into an template email and sends the email to the user.</p>
<h4>Website</h4><p>If someone other than the person registered with ThingSpeak wants to view the current temperature, humidity or Index Air Quality they can do so on the <a href="http://networking-iot-project.surge.sh/">website</a></p>

<h2>Things I tried but didn&#39;t work!</h2><h3>WIA</h3><p>I initially setup my data to be sent to WIA and was going to trigger my email from there, but there were a number of issues. Initially I had the graphs set up and when i tried to embed the graphs into my website they did not show. I contacted the customer help chat and was told this was not a feature they had setup even though they had the embed code attached to the widget. In fairness to them they set it up straight away and within an hour or two i was able to view the graphs. However the embedded digit values updated on the website instantly but the line graphs did not update with live data, you needed to refresh the web page every time to see the current line graphs that corresponded with the digit display. I sent messages to WIA a few times about this but got no reply and their chat bot seems to be disabled now. I decided to change at this stage to ThingSpeak and was able to embed all graphs into my website, you don&#39;t have to refresh your page to see current data, it updates automatically and I was able to setup e-mail with IFTTT fairly easily. </p>
<h3>Presence detection - bluez bluetooth &amp; nmap</h3><p>I find that arp-scan sometimes does not detect you when you are at home so i decided to try <a href="http://www.bluez.org/about/">bluez</a> a linux bluetooth protocol stack, to scan for bluetooth devices, This worked at the beginning and seemed more accurate but it took longer and after a while everytime i ran a bluez scan it would cause the connection from my SSH to the Raspberry Pi to crash. I then tried nmap and again this was more accurate but constant running of this command also caused the connection between my SSH and Raspberry Pi to crash, so I reverted to arp-scan.</p>
