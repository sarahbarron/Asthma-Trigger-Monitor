# Asthma Trigger Monitor
________________________________________
## Student Name: Sarah Barron Student ID: 20013679 Project Description

I currently have 2 asthma and allergy sufferers living in my house and there are a number of triggers that effect their asthma including 

1. Dust 
2. Moist/damp air 
3. and Temperature 

Therefore, the project I am proposing is a device to monitor air quality, temperature and humidity within the home. 

If the temperature goes below 18 degrees or above 22 degrees a message will be sent to the user to turn on or off the heating. 

If the moisture levels go outside the 30-50% range a message will be sent to turn on/off the dehumidifier/humidifier. 

If the AQI measurement goes above 50 a warning will be sent to improve the air quality by dusting, hoovering, opening windows, washing bed cloths etc.
