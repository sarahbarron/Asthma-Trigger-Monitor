    <h1> About This Project </h1>
    <p>
        As a student at Waterford Institute of Technology one of the modules I am studying is Computer Networking. The
        project which we are required to complete is to create a project with the following specification.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Propose a project
            <ul>
                <li>
                    See my proposal <a href="proposal.html">here</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a working project using networking/IoT standards & protocols.
            <ul>
                <li>I used HTTP, ARP, I2C protocol and
                    Wireless WIFI
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Requires a "physical" aspect â€“ sensors/devices
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I used a Raspberry Pi 3B and connected a BME680 sensor
                    to it reading in current temperature, humidity and gas data
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Present and communicate your work in a clear, correct manner
            <ul>
                <li>I presented the project with a <a href="https://github.com/sarahbarron/Asthma-Trigger-Monitor"
                        target="_blank">Git
                        Repository,</a></li>
                <li>a detailed <a href="https://github.com/sarahbarron/Asthma-Trigger-Monitor"
                        target="_blank">Readme</a>,</li>
                <li>a <a href="video.html">video,</a> </li>
                <li>and this website.</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The project should incorporate the different layers (sensor, processing node,
            gateway, application) of an IoT/connected device architecture.
            <ul>
                <li>I used The BME680 sensor to sense data</li>
                <li>I used the Raspberry Pi to connect to the sensor and send data to cloud IoT technologies Blynk and
                    ThingSpeak</li>
                <li>I used my Android SmartPhone and laptop to view sensor data, notifications and emails</li>
                <li>I used a WIFI router as a gateway for my devices to cloud IoT platforms</li>
                <li>I used HTTP for messaging</li>
                <li>I used ARP for presence detection</li>
                <li>I used ThingSpeaks MATLAB Analysis and Time Control to trigger IFTTT to send me an email each
                    morning</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
